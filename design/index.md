# Stickers

Designed for the Data Science Student Society Club at UCSD, which I was a part of. Printed with [Moo](https://www.moo.com/us/products/stickerbooks.html), which I highly recommend! Great quality stickers which are infinitely customizable and reasonably priced. Also credit to Moo for putting out a guideline which is super specific and really helped with producing a flawless final product.
