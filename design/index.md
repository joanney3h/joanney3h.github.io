### Stickers

>I have a thing for making stickers sometimes.

![DS3 Stickers](/images/sticker-proofs.jpg)

Designed for the [Data Science Student Society](http://ds3.io) at UCSD, which I was a part of. Yes, that is a hexbin plot with the ever popular Seaborn theme :)

Printed with [Moo](https://www.moo.com/us/products/stickerbooks.html), which I highly recommend! Great quality stickers which are infinitely customizable and reasonably priced. Also credit to Moo for putting out a guideline which is super specific and really helped with producing a flawless final product.
