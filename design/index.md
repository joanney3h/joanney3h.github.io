# Stickers

![DS3 Stickers](/images/sticker-proofs.jpg)

Designed for the [Data Science Student Society](http://ds3.io) at UCSD, which I was a part of. Yes, that is a hexbin plot with the ever popular Seaborn theme :)

Printed with [Moo](https://www.moo.com/us/products/stickerbooks.html), which I highly recommend! Great quality stickers which are infinitely customizable and reasonably priced. Also credit to Moo for putting out a guideline which is super specific and really helped with producing a flawless final product. 

# Websites

![Website Mockup](/images/boat-page.png)

Threw together a mockup for a hackathon project I was a part of. Full non-functioning site [here](http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~joy030/). Also my first attempt at anything front-end using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/). 


I mostly use [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) because that's what I own.
