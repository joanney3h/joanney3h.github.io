# Is there a lower bound to post length?!

Everything on the internet is getting shorter and shorter. 
Post length is clearly trending downwards as seen by the progression from Novel -> Magazine -> Online News -> Buzzfeed -> etc. Or LiveJournal/Xanga -> MySpace -> Facebook -> Twitter -> Snapchat. Or Match.com -> OkCupid -> Tinder. What's next?! Honest question. I'm betting my money on any company who can make a dating app faster than Tinder.
