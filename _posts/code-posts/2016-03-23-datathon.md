# Local Data Hackathon Project 

My team and I were presented with variable large data sets from partners of the hackathon. We decided to dive deeper into data from a nearby school for underprivledged kids. With no guidance, we looked at the data and wanted to see if we could find in the data, reasons for misbehavior later on.
