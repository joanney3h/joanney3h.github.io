# Local Data Hackathon Project 

My team and I were presented with various large data sets from partners of the hackathon. We decided to dive deeper into data from a nearby school for underprivileged and homeless children. After looking at the available data, we saw some interesting disciplinary trends that led us to ask the questions about the fairness of certain teachers. 

*While some who are subjected to discipline can feel targeted by certain teachers, does the data reflect such discrimination?* 

We did all the analysis in Python and presented our findings in a Jupyter Notebooks. After our reports were selected as finalists, we gave a final presentation in a powerpoint with our takeaways.
