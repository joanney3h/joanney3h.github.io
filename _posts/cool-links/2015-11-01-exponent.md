It's a fantastic podcast that really goes in depth on the tech landscape from a business strategy and economic perspective. While there are many other podcasts talking about the current state of tech, Exponent really gets at what's happening in the meat of the business, rather than talking about the superficial news updates common elsewhere. 

Long and thought-provoking.
