# Current:
Behavioral Researcher working at the [Common Cents Lab](commoncentslab.org) to design and test solutions to increase the financial well being of low to middle income Americans. I'm generally interested in how technology can shape human behavior.

# Past:
I've had a mix of academic and industry experience, in the areas concerning consumer behavior. I'm happiest crunching numbers where data meets behavior, especially with respect to individual spending habits. Last summer I studied abroad in [Berlin](/images/berlin-badeschiff.png) and the summers before that, I was an intern at [Chartcube](http://www.chartcube.com) and worked at the [Rady Behavioral Lab](http://rady.ucsd.edu/behavioral-lab/) as a research assistant.  You can check out some of the work [here](http://rady.ucsd.edu/behavioral-lab/news/). My professor also recently released a novel about behavioral economics and finding the right incentives, which you can find [here](http://www.amazon.com/The-Why-Axis-Undiscovered-Economics/dp/1610393112).
