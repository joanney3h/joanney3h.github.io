# Current:
Senior Behavioral Researcher at [Common Cents Lab](commoncentslab.org), working with financial technology companies to design and test product changes to increase the financial well-being of low-to-middle income Americans. I'm generally interested in how technology shapes human behavior. Also enjoying San Francisco weather. 
I'm happiest crunching numbers where data meets behavior, especially with respect to individual spending habits

# Past:
I've had a mix of academic and industry experience, largely focused on analyzing consumer behavior. Previously, analyzed growth and product at [Chartcube](http://www.chartcube.com), lead research assistant at the [Rady School of Management](http://rady.ucsd.edu/centers/behavioral-lab/). You can check out some of the work from then [here](http://rady.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/gneezy/). My professor also recently released a novel about behavioral economics and finding the right incentives, which you can find here:[The Why Axis: Hidden Motives and the Undiscovered Economics of Everyday Life](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Axis-Undiscovered-Economics-Everyday/dp/1610393112).
