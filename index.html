<h1 id="current">Current</h1>
<p>Behavioral Researcher working at the <a href="commoncentslab.org">Common Cents Lab</a> to design and test solutions to increase the financial well being of low to middle income Americans. I’m generally interested in how technology can shape human behavior.</p>

<h1 id="past">Past</h1>
<p>I’ve had a mix of academic and industry experience, in the areas concerning consumer behavior. I’m happiest crunching numbers where data meets behavior, especially with respect to individual spending habits. Last summer, I studied abroad in <a href="/images/berlin-badeschiff.png">Berlin</a> and the summers before that, I was an intern at <a href="http://www.chartcube.com">Chartcube</a> and worked at the <a href="http://rady.ucsd.edu/behavioral-lab/">Rady Behavioral Lab</a> as a research assistant.  You can check out some of the work <a href="http://rady.ucsd.edu/behavioral-lab/news/">here</a>. My professor also recently released a novel about behavioral economics and finding the right incentives, which you can find <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Why-Axis-Undiscovered-Economics/dp/1610393112">here</a>.</p>
